In this week's response, we were required to build a resume page with basic HTML and CSS. Below you will find a link to the page I created, along with the source code. I'd appreciate any comments below (I'm not following DRY for some CSS, there's definitely some faux-paus with the HTML. I'm new to this!) Enjoy.

And the source code:<br />

<a href="../../../resume_css.txt">Source CSS</a>
