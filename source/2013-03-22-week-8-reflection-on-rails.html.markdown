Two months down, two more sets of two to go.

At this point in the program, I'm feeling fairly confident about Ruby - Rails, not so much. It's odd, but I think I actually get a little overwhelmed when things are auto-generated for me. What's going on in this scaffolding thing? My spec and databases are set up for me? ALL FINDER METHODS are given?

It seems that those pieces of the puzzle, which we'd mastered over the previous 8 weeks, were just the beginning of building apps - so much so, that they're essentially given to you at the beginning of your app. Now, this obviously is why Rubyists love Rails. It gets you going without a lot of the messy grunt work, and has a lot of intuitive features and methods if you know how to call them. My issue right now is that I really don't.

After finishing blogger, a simple blog using rails, I feel like I have a lot of the basic concepts down. Everything I've learned so far seems pretty simple at this point. And (again for whatever reason) that makes me nervous. Where's the complexity? What roadblocks should I be worried about in StoreEngine (our next project)? I suppose these are natural questions, questions I'm sure I asked myself at the beginning of other projects. Inevitibly the complexity creeps in.

I do like that our blogger project was such a simple introduction to such a powerful web framework. However, I can't help but feel a little behind in the class now. I didn't realize so many folks had Rails experience - about half the class worked on a more complex Rails project this week, seperate from the beginner class. I was fortunate to be placed in a 3-person group with two of those folks, John and Josh, for our StoreEngine project. Hopefully I'll be able to learn from them and catch up to their level of understanding. As Fowler mentioned in "The Passionate Programmer" - I'll be the worst person in the band. And that's a good thing.

As Jeff mentioned, the 'gradual release of responsibility' is kicking in on this next project. The reins have loosened, the requirements, while still there, give you a little more freedom. StoreEngine needs to have a certain set of features, but we can customize them or build them however we choose. This is exciting - a little closer to real working experience.

Jeff also asked us what speakers we might want to come visit gSchool. We've already been graced with a wide range of interesting speakers who've brought technical, personal and life perspective to our class. I'd be interested in hearing from the CEO/CTO of a successful start-up next - or someone who was there from the humble beginnings and has seen the project flourish. Someone along the sames lines of Paul Campbell at HyperTiny with Tito, but who has perhaps seen their product or service evolve past the beta phase. Granted, there are folks who could speak to us from all around the Galvanize space about this - but perhaps a company with a little more reputation nationally would be interesting. Groupon and Twitter obviously come to mind.

Anyway, excited to keep working with Rails, and hoping that it really starts to click.
