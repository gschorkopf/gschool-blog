Breaking up my usual freeform flow this time around. Don't have much time today, so I'm going Q&A style:

Q: Now that you’ve had exposure to more companies, through interviews, shadowing, and guest speakers, how has it refined what you’re looking for? Do you feel that you’ll be able to pick a perfect fit, or will you have to take something that seems "good enough"?

A: Great question, me. I haven't done a technical interview, but from what I perceive the market is definitely open to a LOT of opportunity. I've decided I want to move back to Atlanta, so the biggest hinderence to my search has been because of this geo-focus, as well as not being in the city to actually get a feel for companies / the Ruby group there. There are definitely a few companies that have picqued my interest, and Jeff has been wonderful with connections in the area. The biggest concern for me is making sure I find a company that is a good culture fit, and one where I'll continue to grow and can contribute to on day one.

Q: What are you looking to learn or master over our remaining weeks? As people (including you) are more and more distracted with the job hunt, will that be possible? What techniques and strategies will you use to manage your time and goals? Are there any ways that the job hunt is pushing you to "learn harder"?

A: Another hard-hitting question, me. It's definitely an annoyance that people had extricate the job hunt from their daily work. We're here to learn, we're at a school. But it's very similar to senior year of college (let's call it... "senior month" at gSchool), where folks are getting replies from companies, getting excited to start the next step in their careers, and basically checking out. I hope that things will settle down when people are actually locked into a new role, but you never know. In any case, I hope to focus on front-end technologies for the remainder of the course. JavaScript, Angular.js and refining my knowledge of CSS3/HTML5. I'm excited to get really rolling with Jasmine, and hope that I can get a lot of good refactoring, testing, and best practices under my belt before July 19.

Q: Final question. In these last weeks, what are the things you most need from us as an instructional team? Are there any gaps you’re looking to fill? Technologies you want to touch?

A: Well, me, that was technically two questions. But I'll go with it anyway. As I mentioned, I definitely want to understand the best practices and have a series of class sessions on JavaScript. I wouldn't mind hashing back over Eloquent Ruby and RSPEC either. I keep telling myself I should ask to pair with folks in the area, and have been able to with my mentor Mike and Soloman. But I feel like I haven't really taken full advantage of my resources. It's hard to tell. In any case, we still have 4 more weeks of this program. I want to make sure I get in as much learning as possible before the resources available to me are gone.
