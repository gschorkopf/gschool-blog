Week Zero of gSchool Zero, and what a week it was. A week of firsts:

- First time unemployed
- First exploration of Denver
- First time away from all family/friends
- First time using gits/sublime/twitter/etc, and of course,
- First foray into development

Nervous excitment from the get-go. Saturday, I came into the Galvanize space and met a few fellow gSchoolers. Lovely to get to meet some folks, hear about their backgrounds.
