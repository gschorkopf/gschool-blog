I think the topic that I'm most excited about using is regular expressions. I'm a little shakey about when and how the expressions should be used, but excited to see the creative flexibility and power of the expression set. Using stars, sets, ranges, and more seem incredibly useful. In my past work with Google Analytics, we used a limited set of regular expressions for search term matching. I think I'm most hesitant to use regular expressions because my weak grasp on the more minute propensities. What was that way that you represent a number again? What about if it's a set of letters? When will an expression return nil?

"Eloquent Ruby" is formatted in a very specific way. It reads like a grammar book or a manners book; this is how you should write Ruby, but this won't tell you how to use it in the context of a complex program. Certainly, "Eloquent" uses specific examples, I just find it a little more abstract than practical. What sort of program would use regular expressions? One that performs complex search functionalities, I assume? It's like knowing everything about a word, except how to use it in a sentance. I imagine that the lessons in "Eloquent" will translate to real-world applications the more and more we practice. In this way, this book might serve as more of a reference than I expected.

Though the book has been fairly straightforward so far, I still struggle with a concept like "dynamic  typing." Dynamic typing, which is where operations perform at run-time, is quite the mystery. In class, we've hardly gone over topics beyond the language itself. We briefly discussed topics like the RVC or stack traces, but don't go too much into the programmer theory or how Ruby actually communicates with C. I felt like this section was a little tougher to grasp as I didn't have the CS foundations to understand what was going on.
