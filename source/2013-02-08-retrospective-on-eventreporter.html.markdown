EventReporter was a simple CSV parser that gathered information from a database (in this case, from a spreadsheet of some 5,000 event attendees) and organized them in various ways. THe program was also capable of searching for people in creative ways and saving these searches in new CSVs.

I put many hours of work into this project, but it's hard to say how many of those hours were productive. In total, I spent around 6 hours Monday and Tuesday on this project, and then about 8 on Wednesday. I found that many hours on Monday were spent figuring out ways to actually tackle the project, rather than actual coding. Further, I found I was asking and being asked about the project far more than probably needed. This potentially stems from being unable to wrap my brain around the problem. I think going forward I'd like to write more pseudo-code or draw out more of my ideas, rather than stumbling around and seeing what works. I found my best work was done on Wednesday, when I committed to staying later at Galvanize around an environment condusive to work and around a support network that could help when I was lost. Additionally, I was a little more strict with my tomato time Wednesday (and had probably 3 or 4 red bulls that evening).

The resulting project was fairly surprising. I felt mixed levels of confidence going into the project, and wanted my code to be clean and thoughtful from the get-go. I realize now that I should really just do what works and do what I've learned in class, and then refactor or clean up the code later. I was able to complete 3 of the extensions, I feel compulsed to complete them all now. 

As I mentioned, working in the Galvanize space definitely helped boost my productivity. Turning off all distractions (cell phones, email) also helped. I wished I'd used more pseudo-code, as I'm not at a fluent level with the Ruby language where I can write code and then immediately understand what it's doing or where I might go with it. I worked well when surrounded by mentor/mentee peer relationships as well. I'd definitely like to understand going forward how objects interact. Ruby is an OO language, and my program ended up being way too functionally driven - I had maybe two objects, one that built out a queue, and one that ran the EventReporter. Maybe it comes with being a simple project, but I feel like my main point of struggle was understanding what objects can do and how they interact.

In all, the project was definitely an individual challenge. Looking forward, I'll be interested to see how I work in a partner setting.
