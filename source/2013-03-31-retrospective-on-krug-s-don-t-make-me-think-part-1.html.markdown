"Don't Make Me Think" reminds me of a quote my playwright professor would iterate time and time again: "if you want to be subtle, be clear." In the context of plays, that meant that you needed to slap the reader/audience in the face -  subtlely will usually go unnoticed. If you're going to be playful or clever, but obvious about it. If you're going to be obvious about something, be even louder and more obvious with it.

In "Don't Make Me Think," many concepts hold true to this. Even the subtle changes to tab color or subtitle placement or the phrasing in a search bar can change the users perception of how to interact with that object. And while the book itself is pretty ancient in technology-years (Yahoo! was still the pre-dominant search engine. Wow), the basics still hold true. The book reminds me a bit of "The Passionate Programmer," in that the stories in each are fairly obvious and common knowledge, but still important to hash out in detail. In PassProg: Yeah, I know that I should be writing tests - but why? In DMMT: Yeah, sure, I'll write a navbar to make my site accessible - but how?

From a design perspective, I can see why bootstrap or similar scaffolding defaults have become popular - not only do they offer simplicity in code, but also they provide users with an obvious interactive design. That button SHOULD LOOK like a button. It should be obviously clickable. It should say "submit" - not something overcomplicated. There should be no hestiation in the understanding of what the button does and what form it submits.
