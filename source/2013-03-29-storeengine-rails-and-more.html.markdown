This week we began work on our first major Rails project, "StoreEngine". We have another 6 days to complete the project. StoreEngine is building a multi-model eCommerce platform - our group has chosen to sell clothing, grub, tools, and more items that you might need on the Oregon Trail. We wanted to experiment with a fun theme, have a good selection of categories and products, and make sure not to overcomplicate the project.

One of the most confusing component of Rails thus far is probably the large set of files and directories given at your first "rails new" command. I still find it tricky to remember what folder exactly I should be looking in to find my products model, or my user features spec. This problem is obviously a necessary evil - solving a difficult problem with a complex directory set. In fact, I'm sure I'll get more accustomed to the workflow the more I work. Some of the confusion had to do with the extra files created by my teammates; we all pushed and pulled from Github and this is the first time we've worked in a group larger than pairs.

There was also an increased emphasis on pairing this week. I honestly don't think my group took much of it to heart. I would have liked to pair more, especially to understand my partners' code. I found that when I was able to explain myself and a pair's code, I learned a lot about what I did and did not understand in Rails. I think Jennifer and I hit a good stride when working on Capybara testing and stubbing together. I was able to understand a lot and help myself down the line when writing specs. 

On Wednesday, Joesph Wilk also video chatted in to our class to talk acceptance tests. It made me want to try out Factory Girl and other gems he mentioned. Though the material was a bit dense over Skype, I did find my testing improved, especially when looking at the user experience both from a 'views' component and making pretty spec tests.

I've been working with Josh and John on our StoreEngine, and so far, I have to say the process has been surprisingly painfree. The two of them seem fairly seasoned with Rails, and I'm catching on relatively quickly. Not to say there hasn't been a good deal of personal frustrations with my code (dealing with stubbing CanCan and Sorcery, trying to work over and through Bootstrap with my own CSS, and navigation are some of the initial problems). I'm hoping we can really go above and beyond on this project and make it amazing. Right now I'd say it's at the "decent" stage - most of the right things are working, it mostly looks okay, but has nothing that really puts it over the top. We have some ideas for next week's demo (a big first!), but I don't want to ruin the surprise.

Here are some demo shots of our design progression so far. Cheers.
