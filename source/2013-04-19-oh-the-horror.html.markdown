Our Son of Store Engine <a href="http://pink-sose.herokuapp.com/">project</a>.

I believe Son of Store Engine was a great learning experience, for the better and the worse. On the one hand, I felt my group worked hard, paired well, and only ran into a few personality clashes (but those miscommunications or conflicting ideas were rare, and usually fueled by a tight deadline). I think we did well with prioritizing our stories - we split up and did the two most important stories first, building out the store VCM and building out the checkout process. I definitely solidified my personal knowledge of Rails basics, and it was helpful to pair with Erin or Laura.

On the other hand, the resulting product was a little bit dull. We weren't able to deliver amazing content because we just got to the base expectations on Wednesday - and still had some failing features. Cleaning up those became a priority, and as a result, UX and UI suffered. From a logical perspective, the UX was clean - buttons looked like buttons, the site was easier to navigate than my past projects. From a 'wow' perspective, there wasn't a whole lot to differentiate our site from the lot. 

It's hard to discern the exact reasons for these failures. There seemed to be a lot of the same pitfalls across teams. I was fairly proud that my team was able to hunker down and produce a functional project - but I think we all felt disappointment on the deadline date.

I've kept track of my time for this project, and would estimate that I spent around 8 hours more / week than I had on previous projects. So the time input was there - but perhaps the efficiency wasn't? 

I think the biggest tragedy of this project was the lack of focus on performance (New Relic) in the face of expanded databases. It would appear that we are focusing on that next week.
