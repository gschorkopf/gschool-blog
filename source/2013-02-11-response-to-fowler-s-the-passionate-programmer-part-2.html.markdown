Upon completing 'The Passionate Programmer', some of the ressonating topics include those on "enjoying the journey," and making deliberate choices in the code you choose to learn, the companies you choose to work for, and the goals you set in mind. As far as codes you choose to learn, Fowler balances knowledge of the bleeding edge with that of the popular. In any regard, he urges you to keep learning, regardless of what you choose to learn. I hope to keep updated with the latest trends in software development via Twitter, Hacker News, and other sources. 

Regarding companies I choose to work for, Fowler emphasizes working somewhere that energizes you. I've heard various stories, from the founder of Github choosing the excitement of a startup he was passionate in over a 6-figure salary to Steve choosing Jumpstartlab for the company culture over a corporate structure. I don't believe I belong in a company that doesn't value several of Fowler's tips, including the 8-hour burn. Additionally, corporate structure doesn't really interest me, and Fowler seems to empathize with that sentiment throughout the book.

I obviously think it would be difficult to keep up with some of the major tips ('already obsolete', 'the south Indian monkey trap') because of my limited knowledge and understanding of coding languages. At this point, I think Ruby is the end-all-be-all of OO programming, but for all I know, this notion will disipate in a year or two. I'm excited to get a firm grasp on Ruby, but also feel confident enough to let loose my grasp if another language comes along (unlike the Indian monkeys). I'm excited to learn JavaScript, and once I get comfortable with these languages, move on to other languages as well.
